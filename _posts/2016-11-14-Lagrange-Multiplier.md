title: A short intro to Lagrange Multiplier 
---
In this article I will try my best to explain what exactly a **Lagrange Multiplier** means and how these multipliers play important role in solving some of the crucial optimization problems in the context of machine learning.

Before getting started with Lagrange multipliers lets understand **contour lines**. The better we understand contour lines, the more we can visualize whats happening with Lagrange multipliers.

A **contour** is a way to visualize a three-dimensional function in two dimensions. In such a representation of the function, for each point on a contour line, the function returns the same value. Lets consider the following three functions.
