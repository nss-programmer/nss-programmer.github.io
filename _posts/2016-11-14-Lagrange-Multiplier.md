title: A short intro to Lagrange Multiplier 
---
In this article I will try my best to explain what exactly a **Lagrange Multiplier** means and how these multipliers play important role in solving some of the crucial optimization problems in the context of machine learning.

Before getting started with Lagrange multipliers lets understand **contour lines**. The better we understand contour lines, the more we can visualize whats happening with Lagrange multipliers.

A **contour** is a way to visualize a three-dimensional function in two dimensions. In such a representation of the function, for each point on a contour line, the function returns the same value. Lets consider the following three functions.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/contours1.png)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/contours2.png)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/contours3.png)

In all the above cases for each point on the contour line, the function returns the same value. And one more thing to notice is darker the area is, smaller the value of the function is.
