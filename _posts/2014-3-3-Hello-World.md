title: My stint as a problem setter at Codechef
---

The problem statement of P vs NP appears to be deceptively simple on the surface, but it is colossal underneath. The main objective is to determine whether there exist problems whose solution can be quickly checked, but which require an impossibly long time to solve by any direct procedure.

I havn't yet dared to solve P vs NP, but as of now my interest particularly lies in formulating approximation algorithms for hard graph theoretic problems. In this context I would like to thank **Team Codechef** for giving me opportunity to write the following approximation problems for their long contests.
